The joint team (headed by Gérard Huet from INRIA and Amba Kulkarni from University of Hyderabad) decided to hold the First workshop in October 2007. It was also decided to open the meeting to outside researchers and to profit of the workshop to organize the <i><a href="http://sanskrit.inria.fr/Symposium/"> First International Sanskrit Computational Linguistics Symposium </a></i> at this occasion. The symposium was hosted by Gérard Huet at INRIA Paris-Rocquencourt from 29 - 31 October 2007, and led to the formation of the International Sanskrit Computational Linguistics Consortium.</a></font></tr></td>
